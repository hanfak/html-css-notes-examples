        <p>My name is August Ada King. I'm the Countess of Lovelace.</p>

        <p>I am a mathematician and a writer. People know me from my work on
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Babbage">Charles Babbage's </a>
        early mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical engine. I wrote the first algorithm intended to be processed by a machine. In other words,
          <span class="highlight">I am the world's first programmer</span>
        .</p>

        <p>My mother, Anne Isabella Byron, was a great help to me as she helped me by promoting my interest in mathematics and logic, but I also never forgot about my dad, who moved to Greece when I was just an infant to help out in the civil war.</p>

        <blockquote>&ldquo;I do not believe that my father was such a poet as I shall be an Analyst; for with me the two go together indissolubly.&rdquo;</blockquote>

        <p>Throughout my life, mathematics have been my primary interest. I always question even basic assumptions by integrating poetry, another great love of mine, and science. I also have a keen interest in scientific developments and trends of my era like phrenology and mesmerism.</p>

        <p>
         Charles Babbage wrote the following poem about me
         <br/>
         <span>
           Forget this world and all its troubles and if<br/>
           possible its multitudinous Charlatans-every thing<br/>
           in short but the Enchantress of Numbers.
